title: 'Containers'
---
<p>Containers are a cool thing. Not only are they useful in terms of
portability, security, etc. but the technology behnd them is intrinsically
interesting.</P>

<p>I hope, here I will be able to put together a great variety of resources
showing not only how to use containers to package and deploy real applications
but to also to explore the Go packages that make this possible and the C
libraries that pioneered such things.</p>
